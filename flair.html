    <p class='flair-info'><img src='http://www.animateit.net/data/media/feb2013/scaled.gif' class='rage'>Flair dev is our most beloved raging developer for this game. Literally, all she spent her time
    doing was raging the entire weekend she had to create this project in 4 days- just because 'the boss' said so.
    So, since she raged her life away and is still currently hiding in a rabbit hole with Trix the rabbit because she's going
    mad, she decided to make her game in hard mode. You cannot escape it unless you change the code. You must play tic-aroo
    with a spinning board. <br><br> <img src='http://cdn1.thehookmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/popcorn.gif' class='squirrel'>No, Flair dev is not a real dev nor is it a real name.
    <br>We are trying to protect her identity from criminal squirrels right now, so we cannot disclose that information.
    In exchange for safety from Trix the rabbit, she gave up her precious gummy bears. She is now safe from those plotting squirrels- for now. She told me to write this,
    and I have no say in what she tells me to do because I am her pet bat who is using my feet to type. <br><br>...<br><br> Anywhoo~ <br><br>
    Flair Dev and I hope you enjoy this awful Tic-Tac-Toe game, and if you're an epileptic- I'm really sorry about this.
    <br><br> Even if you're not an epileptic, I'm really sorry.</p>
