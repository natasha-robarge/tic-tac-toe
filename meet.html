    <p class='ai-info'>Meet Julia, the computer player designed for our specialty Tic-Tac-Toe game. Julia is an
    AI with a lot of personality. Such as failing to comply unless she wants to when reading code. She also
    has a tendency to take things the wrong way and mess up everything the developer makes. In her spare time,
    Julia likes to create a robot language humans can't understand, and has lost friends by communicating in this
    forbidden language. Julia also really hates water. Do not try to give Julia water. She will haunt you and you will
    regret it. Julia is forever stuck playing Tic-Tac-Toe for our company's profit gain and the player's amusement.
    Julia really hates Tic-Tac-Toe, and therefore, she is absurdly easy to beat.<br> Also, DO NOT TRY TO SCAN THE BARCODE.
    IT IS HER LIFELINE. You also wouldn't find anything anyways. If you really wanted the barcode, go to google fonts.<br>
   <br><br>
   That is all....</p>
