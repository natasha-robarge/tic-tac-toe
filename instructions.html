    <p class='instruct-info'>Well, if you were shut in from the world your whole life and don't know how to play
    Tic-Tac-Toe, but have heard of Tic-Tacs the mint thingys and can play Go-Fish, I don't know what to tell you.
    Let me just dumb it down for you, just in case. So the 'goal' of Tic-Tac-Aroo is to get three in a row.
    It is the original Connect4 by Hasbro if you get my drift. The first player is either X or O and the second player...<br>
    Obviously gets the second pick.<br> You do your best to get three X's or O's either diagonally. in a row, or down
    a column or until all 9 squares are filled.<br>If all 9 squares are filled and there is nothing in a row, no one wins.
    <br><br>Got it?<br><br>Cool. Go get 'em.</p>
